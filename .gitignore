# HOW TO USE THIS FILE

# Installing this package works best if you do a little preparation first.
# Whether you create your initial repository on GitHub, or use the Git Source Control Provider Visual Studio extension,
# a default .gitignore file will already be at the root of your git repository.
# Usually, this means it is directly within your main solution folder, as a sibling to your MyProject.sln file,
# your .git folder, and possibly your packages directory.

# In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right click your Solution node and select `Add > Existing Item`.
# Navigate to the root .gitignore file and add it.
# It will appear in your "Solution Items" folder, but only the path, not the file name.
# This is because the file does not contain a name before the extension. Yay windows.
# Regardless, this provides an easy way to get at your .gitignore file, which you will need to do after installing this package.

# Now install this package. You will notice that a git.ignore file is added to your project directory (not your solution directory).
# This is another wonderful windows *feature* that prevents nuget packages from copying nameless / extension-only files.
# It doesn't matter though. All you have to do is open this git.ignore file (which you already have done), select all, copy,
# then open your other .gitignore from the Solution Items folder select all, and paste.
# When you are done, REMOVE THIS PACKAGE. You don't need it any more. It's pointless and it's wasting bits.

# Unless you want to push all of your packages to your remote repository, enable NuGet Package Restore on your solution.
# This .gitignore will make sure that NuGet.exe gets added, and your packages stay off of the remote.

# Finally, you can delete all of this text to and including the #BEGIN GIT IGNORES line below.
