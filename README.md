# MDK-Mockups
### A set of community driven mockup classes to enable the simulation of Space Engineers ingame scripts in Visual Studio

**This repository is add-in to [MDK-SE](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE).**

Currently just getting set up, the intent of this repository is to gradually build up a set of mockup classes so you can test-run your MDK scripts in Visual Studio, thus having the full debugging capacity of that IDE on hand.

This repository was set up based on the request of members of the community. While I will probably eventually be contributing myself too, I will for the most part take a more advisory position as I have too many running projects already to take on yet another. This means that this repository is _very_ dependent on the community. If the community will not contribute, this repo will be too narrow to be helpful for many. This means that we need _your_ help to do it.

**Currently in experimental stage**

The project is currently in a highly fluent state. The structure has not yet been finalized and there is likely to be breaking changes for a while as we find a base team and decide how we want this to work.

**Please Help**

Like I said, I can't do the heavy lifting on this project. Please contact me on [Keen's discord](https://discord.gg/0hIE7GirODUqhfIg) if you want to help getting the basics of the repo up and running. _We need you_.
